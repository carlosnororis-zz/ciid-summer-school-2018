A Visualization using data for butterflies sightings and (hosted) flowers across Costa Rica

This is a work in progress. A lot of ideas and core features are missing due to, hmmm,
lack of knowledge and/or practice :P. Anyways, we are just testing very basic
D3/illustrator functionalities applied to data visualization techniques.

All the code that was modified as a base to create some of the elements of the
visualization is under the MIT Open License and each reference is expose in the next column.
